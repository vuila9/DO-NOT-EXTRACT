# DO-NOT-EXTRACT
this is a zip bomb, you can download it, but do not extract it.

I uploaded this here primarily for my own future reference, not to cause issues for others. Extracting this file triggers an 'almost' infinite loop that keeps unpacking nested files until it either completes or your computer runs out of disk space. While this might sound problematic, you can interrupt the process if you're a skilled programmer, or simply force a shutdown to stop it. If you accidentally extract it, cleaning up the resulting files can be a hassle, but don't worryâ€”your PC should remain intact. I considered making this repository private, but I believe some people, especially those with a CS background, might find it interesting.

Quick disclaimer: I am not the creator of this bomb.
